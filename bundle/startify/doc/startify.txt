==============================================================================
1. Intro                                                        *startify-intro*

Startify is a zero-conf plugin which shows recently used files, bookmarks and
sessions that were saved to a certain directory.


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                        *startify-usage*

Startify basically provides two things:

1) If you start Vim without giving any filenames to it (or pipe stuff to it so
   it reads from STDIN), startify will show a small but pretty start screen
   which shows recently used files (using viminfo) and sessions by default.

   Additionally, you can define bookmarks, thus entries for files that always
   should be available in the start screen.

   You can either navigate to a certain menu entry and hit enter or you just
   key in whatever is written between the square brackets on that line.

   Per default the startify buffer gets closed automatically, if an entry was
   selected.

   You can reopen the screen via :Startify.

2) It eases handling of loading and saving sessions by only working with a
   certain directory. Two commands are used for convenience:

      :SLoad    load a session
      :SSave    save a session

The default settings are pretty sane, so it should work without any
configuration.


==============================================================================
3. Options                                                    *startify-options*

Put these variables into your vimrc. The shown assignments are also the
default values.

============-

    let g:startify_session_dir = '~/.vim/session'

The directory to save/load sessions to/from.

The default for Windows systems is '$HOME\vimfiles\session'.


============-

    let g:startify_show_sessions = 1

List saved sessions in g:startify_session_dir.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files = 1

List recently used files using viminfo.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files_number = 10

The amount of files to list.


============-

    let g:startify_bookmarks = [ '~/.vimrc' ]

A list of files to bookmark. Those files will always be shown at the bottom of
the start screen.

============-

    let g:startify_skiplist = []

A list of Vim regular expressions to filter recently used files.

Example:   let g:startify_skiplist = [
             \ 'COMMIT_EDITMSG',
             \ $VIMRUNTIME .'/doc',
             \ 'bundle/.*/doc'
             \ ]


============-

    let g:startify_skiplist_server = []

Do not create the startify buffer, if this is a Vim server instance with a
name contained in this list.

Example:   let g:startify_skiplist_server = [ 'GVIM' ]


============-

    let g:startify_unlisted_buffer = 1

Some bad plugins like minibufexpl break, when there is no listed buffer.
People can set this variable to 0, to work around that. As a consequence the
start screen buffer won't be removed, even after triggering an action from the
start screen.


==============================================================================
4. Commands                                                  *startify-commands*

    :SLoad    load a session
    :SSave    save a session

These take either 0 or 1 argument. If you don't specify the session name as an
argument, they will just ask for it.

Providing only a part of the session name works too, if you complete the
argument with either <c-d> or <tab> afterwards.


    :Startify

Open the startify buffer.


==============================================================================
5. FAQ (Or: Typical rants)                                        *startify-faq*

"I don't want the start screen to use cursorline!"
--------------------------------------------------

Startify sets its own filetype "startify". Thus one could set buffer-local
options like this:

    autocmd FileType startify setlocal nocursorline


"Last recently used files don't seem to get updated at :Startify!"
-----------------------------------------------------------

It's because Vim loads the list from viminfo only once, at startup.


"I use iTerm2 and have broken colors when using sessions!"
----------------------------------------------------------

Nothing this plugin could do about. Try playing around with 'sessionoptions'.
Some people swear it works for them with these settings:

    set sessionoptions=blank,curdir,folds,help,tabpages,winpos
