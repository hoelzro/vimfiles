Think regular marks, but for your undo tree.

This plugin adds the following commands to Vim:

ListTemporalMarks - Lists the temporal marks you have set for the given buffer.

AddTemporalMark [mark] - Adds a temporal mark for the current position under the undo tree

JumpToTemporalMark [mark] - Jumps to the given temporal mark
