viewdoc
=======

== Description

Flexible viewer for any documentation source (help/man/perldoc/etc.) for
any file type inside Vim in easy to use, consistent, smart and
configurable way.

 * You can configure how (keys/commands) documentation will be open. By default it will replace standard mapping for key `K` and command `:help` plus add mapping for `<F1>` key and new commands `:man`, `:doc`, etc.
 * You can configure where (buffer/window/tab) documentation will be open. Can open new docs in one dedicated (`K`) or new (`<F1>`) buffer/window/tab. Support all work styles:
   - full screen (no tabs, one window, open files/docs are in hidden buffers), 
   - windowed (no tabs, many windows with open files/docs), 
   - tabbed full screen (many tabs, each with one window, open files/docs are in different tabs), 
   - tabbed (many tabs with many windows inside tabs). 
 * You can easily navigate to next/previous topic while viewing documentation using `<C-]>` and `<C-T>` (or alternative keys `<CR>` and `<BS>`), just like you use tags for navigation within source code and Vim's help.
 * Even closing documentation buffer/window/tab is easier, smarter and more configurable than ever before. :)
 * Smart detection of documentation source and topic when opening documentation for `<cword>` (word under cursor) - can use current syntax highlight (to find topic's context) and surrounding text (when topic doesn't include important special symbols because of 'iskeyword' value).
 * Smart completion for available documentation topics when opening documentation using command (just like Vim's :help command works). (Some documentation sources may not support this.)
 * Supported documentation sources:
   - man pages
   - Vim's help
   - custom documentation in vim help format: (CSS 2.1, CMake, LaTeX, â€¦)
   - perldoc
   - godoc
   - pydoc (python)
   - pman (php)
   - OS Inferno man pages
   - ri (ruby)
   - bash's help
   - GNU info (smart support for: awk, make, m4, automake)
 * Support for new documentation sources and file types can be easily added by external plugins or within ~/.vimrc file.
 * You can have several documentation sources for same file type, and choose which one should be used on-the-fly.
 * Can be used as console man page viewer instead of `/usr/bin/man`.

Tested only in Linux, but should work in any `*NIX`.
